# ðŸŒ¾ Satellite-Based Crop Yield Prediction System

This Final Year Project, submitted to IBA Karachi, is a Pakistan-specific initiative aimed at empowering agricultural stakeholders, researchers, and policymakers with data-driven insights. The system uses multispectral satellite imagery and comparative machine learning models to predict crop yield which addresses the gap of open-source, localized agricultural intelligence in the country.

An additional feature is its end-to-end integration of an LLM-based chatbot, allowing users to interact with the system in natural language. This makes complex yield data and predictions accessible even to non-technical users, enabling better planning, resource allocation, and agricultural decision-making in Pakistan.
