# 🌾 Satellite-Based Crop Yield Prediction System

This Final Year Project, submitted to IBA Karachi, is a Pakistan-specific initiative aimed at empowering agricultural stakeholders, researchers, and policymakers with data-driven insights. The system uses multispectral satellite imagery and comparative machine learning models to predict crop yield which addresses the gap of open-source, localized agricultural intelligence in the country.

An additional feature is its end-to-end integration of an LLM-based chatbot, allowing users to interact with the system in natural language. This makes complex yield data and predictions accessible even to non-technical users, enabling better planning, resource allocation, and agricultural decision-making in Pakistan.

## 🧠 Model Overview
We developed a satellite-based crop yield prediction system using publicly available Landsat imagery, tailored specifically for Pakistan's agricultural landscape.

- Region Focus: Division-wise areas across Pakistan

- Temporal Coverage: Multi-year imagery during the crop growing season

- Data Source: Landsat bands — especially Band 4 (Red) and Band 5 (Near-Infrared) — known for their value in vegetation analysis

### 🔧 Technical Approach
- We extracted relevant infrared and near-infrared data to assess crop health and growth.

- Each sample combined geographic and actual yield data (in kg/ha), forming a rich dataset for training.

- A custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was trained on this data to map satellite features to crop yield.

- Typical yield values ranged between 2000–2500 kg per hectare.

### 🎯 Performance
- Achieved Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of just 11%, reflecting strong prediction accuracy.

- This allows for timely, scalable, and accurate yield forecasting, aiding better agricultural planning, policy-making, and resource allocation.


## Deployment

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev

```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.
